# Generative-Adversarial-Network-with-PyTorch
Build a Generative Adversarial Network with PyTorch 
Overview
This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using PyTorch to generate handwritten images. GANs consist of a generator and a discriminator that are trained simultaneously through adversarial training.

Project Structure
The project is organized into the following sections:

Configurations:

Set up essential configurations such as device, batch size, noise dimension, and optimizer parameters.
Load MNIST Dataset:

Load the MNIST dataset, apply data transformations, and explore basic information about the dataset.
Create Discriminator Network:

Define a discriminator neural network class with convolutional layers to distinguish real from fake images.
Create Generator Network:

Define a generator neural network class with transposed convolutional layers to generate fake images from random noise.
Weight Initialization:

Initialize the weights of the discriminator and generator networks using normal distribution.
Loss Function and Optimizer:

Define functions for calculating the discriminator's real and fake losses. Set up the Adam optimizer for both the discriminator and generator.
Training Loop:

Train the GAN through a specified number of epochs. In each epoch, iterate through the dataset, update the discriminator and generator weights, and print the average discriminator and generator losses.
Visualization:

Visualize generated images during the training process using the show_tensor_images function.
Generate Images:

After training is completed, generate new images using the trained generator.

Notes
Adjust hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and noise dimension based on your requirements.
Experiment with different architectures for the generator and discriminator networks to enhance performance.
Feel free to extend the code for more advanced GAN features or apply it to other image generation tasks.
